    There are _countless_ programs that shell wizards use to manipulate data.
    Each program does specific different things, typically adhering to the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of doing one thing and doing it well.
    You can chain these programs into really awesome composite logic.
    Some examples, that you should learn on your own when you are ready after completing the Linux Luminarium, are:

    - [awk](https://linux.die.net/man/1/awk) for complex text processing
    - [cut](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cut) for extracting parts of lines
    - [less](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less) for an interactive file reader
    - [more](https://linux.die.net/man/1/more) to read parts of files at a time
    - [paste](https://linux.die.net/man/1/paste) to combine files
    - [sed](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sed) for complex text manipulation
    - [sort](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sort) for sorting data
    - [tail](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tail) as an inverse of `head`
    - [uniq](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uniq) for filtering out unique data in a stream
