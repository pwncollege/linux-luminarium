In this challenge, you will invoke your first command!
When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Here, the user executed the `whoami` command, which simply prints the username (`hacker`) to the terminal.
When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

In this level, invoke the `hello` command to get the flag!
Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: `hello` is different from `HELLO`.
