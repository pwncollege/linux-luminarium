Let's try something more complicated: a command with _arguments_.
When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its _arguments_.
The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.
Observe:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello
Hello
hacker@dojo:~$
```

In this case, the command was `echo`, and the argument was `Hello`.
`echo` is a simple command that "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal, like you see in the session above.

Let's look at `echo` with multiple arguments:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello Hackers!
Hello Hackers!
hacker@dojo:~$
```

In this case, the command was `echo`, and `Hello` and `Hackers!` were the two arguments to `echo`.
Simple!

In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the `hello` command (NOT the `echo` command) with a single argument of `hackers`.
Try it now!
