Many see shells as shallow: simply small wrappers around useful utilities.
This is true to an extent, but ignoring the power of the shell can hamper you when you try to accomplish complex things in Linux.
In this module, we will delve into using the _shell_ itself, as opposed to the commandline tools that Linux offers.

Some questions that we will explore:

- How would you print out a file without using `cat`, `more`, and friends?
- How to do math, number base conversion (especially relevant for raw memory operations and hacking).
- How to implement complex functionality right in your shell!

We will learn how to use the functionality built into the shell itself (e.g., builtins and other functionality).
Now, go forth and learn!
