You've learned how to kill other processes with the `kill` command, but sometimes you just want to get rid of the process that's clogging up your terminal!
Luckily, terminals have a hotkey for this: `Ctrl-C` (e.g., holding down the `Ctrl` key and pressing `C`) sends an "interrupt" to whatever application is waiting on input from the terminal and, typically, this causes the application to cleanly exit.

Try it here!
`/challenge/run` will refuse to give you the flag until you interrupt it.
Good luck!
