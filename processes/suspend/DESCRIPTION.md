You have learned to interrupt processes with `Ctrl-C`, but there are less drastic measures you can use to get your terminal back!
You can _suspend_ processes to the background with `Ctrl-Z`.
In this level, we'll explore how this works and, in the next level, we'll figure out how to _resume_ those suspended processes!

This level's `run` wants to see another copy of itself running _and using the same terminal_.
How?
Use the terminal to launch it, then suspend it, then launch another copy while the first is suspended!
