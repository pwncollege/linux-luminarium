You're well on your way to your new life as a shell scripter!
However, so far, your shellscripts _can only be launched from the shell_.
So, things worked great in the previous level (because you were invoking your script from the `bash` shell), but they won't work if your script was being invoked by, say, a program written in Python (or any other language).

When a program is invoked in Linux, the Linux kernel first inspects the file to determine how it should be run.
This does NOT use the extension (which is why you don't _have_ to name your shell scripts with a `.sh` extension, or your Python scripts with a `.py` extension, or so on).
Rather, Linux looks at the first few bytes of the file for this information.

There are a bunch of different types of programs, but if the program file starts with the characters `#!` (often termed a "[shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))"), Linux treats the file as an _interpreted program_, and the contents of the rest of the line as the path to the _interpreter_.
It then invokes the interpreter with the path to the program file as its only argument.

Consider this shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello Hackers!"
```

This can be executed as:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ chmod a+x script.sh
hacker@dojo:~$ ./script.sh
Hello Hackers!
hacker@dojo:~$
```
