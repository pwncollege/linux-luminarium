The easiest way to chain commands is `;`.
In most contexts, `;` separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines.
So, this:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ echo COLLEGE > pwn
hacker@dojo:~$ cat pwn
COLLEGE
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Is roughly the same as this:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ echo COLLEGE > pwn; cat pwn
COLLEGE
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Basically, when you hit Enter, your shell executes your typed command and, after that command terminates, gives you the prompt to input another command.
The semicolon is analogous, just without the prompt and with you entering both commands before anything is executed.

Give it a try now! In this level, you must run `/challenge/pwn` and then `/challenge/college`, chaining them with a semicolon.
