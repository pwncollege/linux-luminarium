You've learned about pipes using `|`, and you've seen that process substitution creates temporary named pipes (like `/dev/fd/63`).
You can also create your own _persistent_ named pipes that stick around on the filesystem!
These are called **FIFOs**, which stands for First (byte) In, First (byte) Out.

You create a FIFO using the `mkfifo` command:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ mkfifo my_pipe
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l my_pipe
prw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 0 Jan 1 12:00 my_pipe
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 0 Jan 1 12:00 some_file
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Notice the `p` at the beginning of the permissions - that indicates it's a pipe!
That's markedly different than the `-` that's at the beginning of normal files, such as `some_file` in the above example.

Unlike the automatic named pipes from process substitution:

- You control where FIFOs are created
- They persist until you delete them  
- Any process can write to them by path (e.g., `echo hi > my_pipe`)
- You can see them with `ls` and examine them like files

One problem with FIFOs is that they'll "block" any operations on them until both the read side of the pipe and the write side of the pipe are ready.
For example, consider this:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ mkfifo myfifo
hacker@dojo:~$ echo pwn > myfifo
```

To service `echo pwn > myfifo`, bash will open the `myfifo` file in write mode.
However, this operation will hang until something _also_ opens the file in read mode (thus completing the pipe).
That can be in a different console:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfifo
pwn
hacker@dojo:~$
```

What happened here?
When we ran `cat myfifo`, the pipe had both sides of the connection all set, and _unblocked_, allowing `echo pwn > myfifo` to run, which sent `pwn` into the pipe, where it was read by `cat`.

Of course, this can somewhat be done by normal files: you've learned how to `echo` stuff into them and `cat` them out.
Why use a FIFO instead?
Here are key differences:

1. **No disk storage:** FIFOs pass data directly between processes in memory - nothing is saved to disk
2. **Ephemeral data:** Once data is read from a FIFO, it's gone (unlike files where data persists)
3. **Automatic synchronization:** Writers block until the readers are ready, and vice-versa. This is actually useful! It provides automatic synchronization. Consider the example above: with a FIFO, it doesn't matter if `cat myfifo` or `echo pwn > myfifo` is executed first; each would just wait for the other. With files, you need to make sure to execute the writer before the reader.
4. **Complex data flows:** FIFOs are useful for facilitating complex data flows, merging and splitting data in flexible ways, and so on. For example, FIFOs support multiple readers and writers.

This challenge will be a simple introduction to FIFOs.
You'll need to create a `/tmp/flag_fifo` file and redirect the stdout of `/challenge/run` to it.
If you're successful, `/challenge/run` will write the flag into the FIFO!
Go do it!

**HINT:**
The blocking behavior of FIFOs makes it hard to solve this challenge in a single terminal.
You may want to use the Desktop or VSCode mode for this challenge so that you can launch two terminals.
