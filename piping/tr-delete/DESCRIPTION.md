`tr` can also translate characters to nothing (i.e., _delete_ them).
This is done via a `-d` flag and an argument of what characters to delete:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ echo PAWN | tr -d 'A'
PWN
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Pretty simple!
Now you give it a try.
I'll intersperse some decoy characters (specifically: `^` and `%`) among the flag characters.
Use `tr -d` to remove them!
