You know how to run commands, how to redirect their output (e.g., `>`), and how to search through the resulting file (e.g., `grep`).
Let's put this together!

In preparation for more complex levels, we want you to:

1. Redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to `/tmp/data.txt`.
2. This will result in a hundred thousand lines of text, with one of them being the flag, in `/tmp/data.txt`.
3. `grep` that for the flag!
