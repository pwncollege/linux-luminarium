Sometimes, the files that you might `cat` out are too big.
Luckily, we have the `grep` command to search for the contents we need!
We'll learn it in this challenge.

There are many ways to `grep`, and we'll learn one way here:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ grep SEARCH_STRING /path/to/file
```

Invoked like this, `grep` will search the file for lines of text containing `SEARCH_STRING` and print them to the console.

In this challenge, I've put a hundred thousand lines of text into the `/challenge/data.txt` file.
`grep` it for the flag!

HINT: The flag always starts with the text `pwn.college`.
