Now, let's put the previous levels together!
We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in `/challenge/files`.
Go `cd` there and, using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to `/challenge/run`) will match **only** the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!

HINT: Make sure to look at the files in `/challenge/files`. Do you see any patterns that could help you make your glob?
