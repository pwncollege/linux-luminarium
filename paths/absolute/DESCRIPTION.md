Let's explore a slightly more complicated path!
Except for in the previous level, challenges in pwn.college are in the `challenge` directory and the `challenge` directory is, in turn, right in the root directory (`/`).
The path to the challenge directory is, thus, `/challenge`.
The name of the challenge program in this level is `run`, and it lives in the `/challenge` directory.
Thus, the path to the `run` challenge program is `/challenge/run`.

This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path.
You'll want to execute the `run` file that is in the `challenge` directory that is, in turn, in the `/` directory.
If you invoke the challenge correctly, it will give you the flag.
Good luck!
