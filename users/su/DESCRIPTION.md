It's not just hackers that need to become `root`.
Oftentimes, you, as the owner of your computer, need to use `root` access to administer it.
Becoming `root` is a fairly common action that Linux users take, and there are two utilities that exist for this purpose: `su` and `sudo`.

In this challenge, we will cover the older one, `su` (the **s**witch **u**ser command).
This is not typically used to elevate to `root` access anymore, but it is an elegant utility from a more civilized time, and we'll cover it first.

`su` is a setuid binary:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 232416 Dec 1 11:45 /usr/bin/su
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Because it has the SUID bit set, `su` runs as `root`.
Running as `root`, it can start a `root` shell!
Of course, `su` is discerning: before allowing the user to elevate privileges to `root`, it checks to make sure that the user knows the `root` password:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ su
Password: 
su: Authentication failure
hacker@dojo:~$
```

This check against the `root` password is what obsoletes `su`.
Modern systems very rarely have `root` passwords, and different mechanisms (that we will learn later) are used to grant administrative access.

But THIS challenge (and only this challenge) _does_ have a `root` password.
That password is `hack-the-planet`, and you must provide it to `su` to become `root`!
Go do that, and read the flag!
