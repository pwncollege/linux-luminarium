You think you can `chmod`?
Let's practice!

This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the `/challenge/pwn` file in specific ways a few times in a row.
If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again.
If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you `chmod` `/flag` to make it readable for yourself :-)
Launch `/challenge/run` to get started!
